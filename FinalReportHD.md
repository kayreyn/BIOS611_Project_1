"Heart Disease - Final Report"
---------------------------

### Introduction

Heart Disease is a broad term that can be applied to many heart conditions that negatively impact heart health.  These complications can arise from a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and unhealthy habits [1].  Individuals with heart disease are at a greater risk for heart attacks and heart failure [2].    

Finding indicators of heart disease can aid doctors in indentifying at risk individuals who need to be placed on preventative treatment. Are there certain demographic information and tests that accurately indicate the prevalence of heart disease in patients?  Which of these indicators have the most weight in determining heart disease status?  Can a model be created to accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical test records?

### Data

The heart disease data used in this project is publicly available from UC Irvine at 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease.  There are thirteen explanatory variables detailing patient demographics (sex, age) and heart test measurements (chest pain, cholesterol levels, etc.).  The response variable, heart disease, indicates the presence of heart disease in a patient.  The original dataset contains measurements on 303 patients.  For this analysis, 6 patients with missing values were removed. After filtering, there are 160 patients without heart disease and 137 patients with heart disease.
